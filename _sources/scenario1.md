# Scenario 1: Genetic Analysis Case Study on FBX011 gene.
## An Undiagnosed Child with Mental Retardation and Facial Dysmorphisms

An undiagnosed child with mental retardation and facial dysmorphisms, with a negative array-CGH analysis, underwent Whole Exome Sequencing (WES). This disclosed a de novo, likely pathogenic, rare variant in the FBX011 gene.
