# Scenario 2: Genetic Analysis Case Study on MAPK1 gene
## A Girl Diagnosed with Noonan-like Syndrome

A girl was diagnosed affected by a Noonan-like syndrome, but she was negative after analysis of an extended panel for Rasopathies. Following Whole Exome Sequencing (WES), a de novo likely pathogenic mutation was found in the MAPK1 gene.
