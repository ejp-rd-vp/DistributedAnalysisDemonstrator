# Scenario 3: Genetic Analysis Case Study on FN1 gene
## A Patient with Spondylometaphyseal Dysplasia and Corner Fractures

A patient affected by spondylometaphyseal dysplasia with corner fractures, a rare form of AD osteocondrodysplasia of unknown genetic origin, underwent Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) analysis. This disclosed a de novo likely pathogenic mutation in the FN1 gene, a gene previously associated with glomerulopathy with fibronectin deposits, a rare kidney disease (KD) not present in the patient.
